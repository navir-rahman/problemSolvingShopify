if cancle bubble, stopPropagation and other doesn't work or can't be used then try 
          var parentel = event.target.parentElement.parentElement;
          if (parentel.classList.contains("class")) {
            // alert(" It Worked!!! ");
            
          }
          
          with this it will be easy to identify and run a code if needed.
